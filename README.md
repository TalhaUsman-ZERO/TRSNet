# TRSNet: Lightweight Transformer-Driven Multi-Scale Trapezoidal Attention Network for Efficient Saliency Detection

This repository contains the official PyTorch implementation of **TRSNet**, a lightweight saliency detection model that leverages transformer-driven multi-scale trapezoidal attention mechanisms for accurate and efficient salient object detection.

## 🔍 Highlights
- **The proposed network balances efficiency and performance via a lightweight design.
- **CFRBs with dilated convolutions enhance multi-scale contextual representations.
- **The introduced TAM effectively refines features by integrating ASCA and CCG.
- **FAMHA blocks capture long-range dependencies and global contextual cues.
- **TRSNet outperforms SOTA methods across six saliency detection benchmarks.
